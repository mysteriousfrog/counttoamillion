# counttoamillion

What are you doing here?!

Oh, I see. You are here about the challenge. Well hackful one, it is simple. You must bring me a Slack bot that meets three conditions:

1. The bot must count toward and reach one million in #counttoamillionbybot
2. The code must live in a public github repo
3. The repo must come with a step-by-step tutorial in README.md

Whoever is first to fulfill these conditions shall receive a $25 visa gift card, dropped into their mailbox from low-earth orbit.

Now go, hackful one. There is work to be done.
